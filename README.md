# MultifilarEvents

This repository contains code related to the manuscript "Unveiling nonequilibrium from multifilar events".

In short, it deals with continuous-time Markov chains that are partially accessible: The only observable information is provided by some transitions and, importantly, the same observable can be produced by more than one transition (thus multifilar).

- **plots_paper.nb**: Mathematica notebook with useful functions for calculating relevant quantities in the framework of multifilar transitions, and the original code used to generate figures of the manuscript.

- **brusselator_simulation.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook used to simulate the simplified Brusselator model and obtain the nonequilbrium estimators/detectors.

- **folder tikz**: TikZ code used to generate some figures.
