# MultifilarEvents

This repository contains code related to the manuscript "Unveiling nonequilibrium from multifilar events".

In short, it deals with continuous-time Markov chains that are partially accessible: The only observable information is provided by some transitions and, importantly, the same observable can be produced by more than one transition (thus multifilar).

In the Mathematica notebook plots_paper.nb, there are useful functions for calculating relevant quantities in the framework of multifilar transitions, and the original code used to generate the figures of the manuscript.
